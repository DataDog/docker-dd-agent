# DogStatsD Dockerfile

This repository is meant to build the image for a DogStatsD container.

## Quick Start

This image is ready-to-go, you just need to set your hostname and `API_KEY` in the environment.

```
docker run -d --name dogstatsd -h `hostname` -e API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY datadog/docker-dd-agent:latest-dogstatsd
```

## Link to other containers

Your other containers will probably want to send data to the DogStatsD container. For that, you can use Docker networks, or add a `--link` option to your run command.

```
docker run  --name my_container \
            --all_your_flags \
            --link dogstatsd:dogstatsd \
            my_image_id
```

Then you will have DogStatsd address and port accessible from your environment in `DOGSTATSD_PORT_8125_UDP_ADDR` and `DOGSTATSD_PORT_8125_UDP_PORT`.
