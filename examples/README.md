# Example Derivative Dockerfile

This folder holds several examples of custom images based on the official one. They are intended to be used as a base for your custom Dockerfiles. This method allows you to:

- embed custom autodiscovery templates
- set complex options that are not available via environment variable bindings

Please refer to the toplevel `README.md` for more information on what customisations are available.
